# Advent Of Code 2020

> My solutions to the code puzzles from [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/), for the curious. Written in JavaScript/Node.js.

Note: There's no tests, and the code isn't meant to be pretty. My goal was to get to the solution as fast as possible. There was no refactoring involved, so what you see is what came to my mind first.

You can run any puzzle with:
```sh
node day<N>/code.js
```
